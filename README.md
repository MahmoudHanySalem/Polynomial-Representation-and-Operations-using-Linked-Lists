Polynomial Representation and Operations 
using Linked Lists Project
This project proposes the development of a program that represents polynomials as 
linked lists and implements various operations on them. The program will handle addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, display, and evaluation of polynomials using a chosen value 
for the variable (x).
